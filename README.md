# Distance-Based-Probability-Modeling-for-Autonomous-Overtaking-Decisions-Using-Object-Detection
A vision-based system for autonomous overtaking on double-lane highways. Uses Kaggle/manual images, preprocessing (Gaussian blur, Canny, Hough Transform) for lane detection. YOLOv3 detects objects; distance estimated via bounding boxes and focal length. A safety model evaluates overtaking feasibility, offering real-time feedback.


In this study, we propose a vision-based system for autonomous overtaking decision-making on double-lane highways, utilizing a small dataset comprising images collected from Kaggle and a few captured manually. The system employs image preprocessing techniques, including Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection, to enhance lane boundary segmentation via the Hough Line Transform. Leveraging the pretrained YOLOv3 object detection model, the system identifies and classifies objects within the driving lane. Distance to the nearest detected object is estimated using bounding box dimensions and a calibrated focal length. A probability-based safety model evaluates overtaking feasibility, dynamically scaling thresholds from unsafe (<10m) to optimal (>25m). This integrated approach provides real-time feedback on overtaking safety, addressing the obstacle avoidance challenge in autonomous driving.
